  <p> Finding out that I spent to much time on games and other sources of entertainment, I am on my progress of quitting it. It feels progressive this time as I found my join in spending time discovering the world of computer. It is a place where I can build my own kingdom without being disturbed and still feels like productive in real-life, in this place I feel myself like the king of my own world, creating what I want, and I think that is the joy of it, so I am on my way of practicing, seeking for the power of manipulation and creation, as well as control my life in the outside world.
